# Early-Detection-of-Type-2-Diabetes
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a growing health problem worldwide, affec􀆟ng hundreds of millions
of people. It o􀅌en develops slowly and may not show symptoms in the early stages. If it isn't
detected and treated in 􀆟me, it can lead to serious health issues like heart disease, kidney
damage, and vision loss.


As more health data becomes available and machine learning (ML) tools improve, there's an
opportunity to create systems that can help detect T2D earlier. In this project, we used ML to
predict whether someone has T2D based on responses to a health survey from the 2015
BRFSS dataset. This kind of tool could support doctors and health officials in spo􀆫ng at-risk
individuals and star􀆟ng treatment sooner
