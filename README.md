# Early-Detection-of-Type-2-Diabetes
The Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a growing global health issue. Many people remain undiagnosed due to the absence of early symptoms. Delayed diagnosis can lead to severe complications. Our project aimed to use machine learning (ML) techniques to predict T2D early using the BRFSS2015 survey dataset.
